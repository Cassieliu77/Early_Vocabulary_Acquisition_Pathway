Extract of the questions from @gebru2021datasheets based on the data from @wordbankr and @cdi


**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    - The Wordbank dataset was created to serve as a platform for archiving, sharing, and exploring anonymized data from the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDI). Its primary goal is to help the study of early vocabulary acquisition across multiple languages by providing a centralized resource for both norming studies and contributed data from various research projects. The dataset solves the need for a comprehensive, accessible repository of CDI data, enabling researchers to generate norms for populations and individual vocabulary items interactively. It also fills a critical gap by supporting cross-linguistic comparisons of early lexical development and enhancing accessibility to standardized benchmarks and diverse linguistic samples. Wordbank builds on the foundation of its predecessor, CLEX, by offering improved functionality as both a teaching and research tool. It allows users to explore developmental patterns and generate customized norms for different populations, making it an invaluable resource for linguistic, psychological, and developmental research.
2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - The Wordbank dataset was developed by the Language and Cognition Lab at Stanford University, under the direction of Dr. Michael C. Frank. This initiative is part of Stanford’s broader commitment to advancing research in child language acquisition and cognitive development. The platform compiles data from the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDIs) across multiple languages, serving as a valuable resource for researchers worldwide.
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - The development of Wordbank was funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation (# 1451577) as well as generous support from the MB-CDI Advisory Board.
4. *Any other comments?*
    -The dataset is significant for its contribution to linguistic development research. It emphasizes critical windows of vocabulary growth and includes both norming and non-norming samples, offering standardized benchmarks while reflecting diverse linguistic environments. Its cross-linguistic scope makes it a valuable tool for understanding global patterns in early lexical development.
    
**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- The instances in the dataset represent children aged 16–30 months and their responses from the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDIs). Each instance includes data on the child’s vocabulary comprehension and production, focusing on early language acquisition. The dataset consists of multiple types of information for each child, such as:
	a.	Vocabulary Comprehension: Words the child understands.
	b.	Vocabulary Production: Words the child can produce.
	c.	Lexical Categories: Words grouped by semantic or grammatical categories (e.g., Function Words, Living Things, Adjectives).
	d.	Norming and Non-norming Status: Indicates whether the data come from a standardized norming sample or research projects contributed by individual researchers.
2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- As of the latest data available, the Wordbank dataset comprises 92,771 children and 105,290 CDI administrations, encompassing 42 languages and 89 instruments. 
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- The dataset is a sample drawn from responses collected using the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDIs) across various languages and studies. It includes both norming samples, which are standardized and representative of general language acquisition trends, and non-norming samples, contributed by researchers studying specific subpopulations or contexts. While the norming data provide a validated baseline for comparison, the non-norming data add diversity but may not fully represent population-level trends.
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
  Each instance consists of processed features rather than raw data. Specifically, the data includes:
	•	Child Demographics: Age (in months) and norming status (norming or non-norming group).
	•	Vocabulary Measures:
	•	Word comprehension counts (words the child understands).
	•	Word production counts (words the child can produce).
	•	Lexical Categories: Words grouped by semantic or grammatical categories (e.g., Function Words, Living Things, Adjectives).
5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Yes, the target variable is the binary “High Vocabulary” status, indicating whether a child’s combined comprehension and production exceeds 300 words.
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- Yes, the target variable is the binary “High Vocabulary” status, indicating whether a child’s combined comprehension and production exceeds 300 words.
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- No. Relationships between individual instances are not explicitly defined in the dataset. Each instance represents a single child’s vocabulary data, and the dataset treats these instances independently. However, implicit relationships exist within subgroups, such as children belonging to the same norming sample or sharing similar demographic or linguistic attributes. These relationships are not directly encoded but can be inferred and analyzed using metadata like norming status, age, and language group.
8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- Data can be split into training, validation, and testing sets, stratified by norming status to ensure balanced representation across groups.
9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Potential biases in parental reporting are a source of noise, particularly for abstract word categories such as Sensory Words.
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- The dataset is self-contained but derived from the CDI and Wordbank repositories. External tools like WordbankR were used for data extraction.
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No personally identifiable information is included. The dataset is anonymized and contains only aggregated linguistic data.
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	- No, the dataset focuses on vocabulary acquisition and does not include sensitive information such as ethnicity, religion, or health data.
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- Yes, subpopulations are identified by norming status and age groups, enabling analysis across different demographic and developmental categories.
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- Yes, from the child id
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No, the dataset does not include data that might reveal sensitive personal attributes.
16. *Any other comments?*
	- The dataset offers valuable insights into vocabulary development while balancing standardization and diversity through its dual norming and non-norming sample structure.

**Collection process**

1. *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*
