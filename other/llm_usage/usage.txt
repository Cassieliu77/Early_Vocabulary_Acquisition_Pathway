ChatGPT

The error occurs because scale_x_date() requires the x aesthetic (in this case, date_of_test) to be in the <Date> format. Your error suggests that date_of_test is not being recognized as a valid <Date> object within the ggplot pipeline, even though it might appear to be in the <Date> format.

Here’s a step-by-step solution:

1. Validate the date_of_test Column

Double-check the data type of date_of_test in your analysis_data dataframe:
str(analysis_data$date_of_test)

Your code is mostly correct, but there are a couple of adjustments we can make to ensure the plot is clear and aesthetically pleasing. The key issue is that the color aesthetic should be applied globally to both lines, rather than defining it separately for each geom_line(). Here’s the updated and improved version of your code:
ggplot(analysis_data, aes(x = age)) +

ChatGPT

The warnings indicate that your Bayesian logistic regression model (likely using Stan or a similar backend) is facing convergence and sampling issues. These are critical and need to be addressed before interpreting the results. Below is an explanation of the warnings and how to resolve them.

Key Issues and Fixes

1. Divergent Transitions After Warmup

	•	Meaning: Divergent transitions suggest that the model’s posterior distribution has regions of high curvature, causing problems during sampling.
	•	Fixes:
	1.	Reparameterization: Simplify or reparameterize the model to make it more stable.
	•	For example, use a non-centered parameterization for hierarchical models.
	2.	Increase adapt_delta: Adjust the adapt_delta parameter (controls step size) to a value closer to 1 (e.g., 0.95 or 0.99).
stan_model <- brms::brm(
  formula = ..., 
  data = ..., 
  family = binomial(), 
  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99)
)

2. Maximum Treedepth Exceeded

	•	Meaning: The No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) exceeded the maximum tree depth (default = 10 or 15), which means it is struggling to explore the posterior distribution efficiently.
	•	Fixes:
	1.	Increase max_treedepth:
stan_model <- brms::brm(
  formula = ..., 
  data = ..., 
  family = binomial(), 
  control = list(max_treedepth = 20)
)

3.Low Bayesian Fraction of Missing Information (BFMI)

	•	Meaning: This indicates poor exploration of the posterior distribution, often caused by poorly scaled or ill-conditioned data.
	•	Fixes:
	1.	Standardize Predictors: Ensure all predictors have mean 0 and standard deviation 1. 
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(across(c(age, production), scale))

ChatGPT

The simplified logistic regression model performs better by focusing solely on the dominant predictor, `prod_comp_mean_scaled`. Here’s an analysis of the model:

---

### Model Summary:
1. **Intercept**:
   - Estimate: `-993.9`
   - Significance: Strongly significant (`p < 0.001`).

2. **Predictor (`prod_comp_mean_scaled`)**:
   - Estimate: `5149.8`
   - Significance: Strongly significant (`p < 0.001`).

3. **Fit Statistics**:
   - **Null Deviance**: `1.3171e+07`, indicating high variability in the outcome initially.
   - **Residual Deviance**: `2.9904e-01`, indicating the model explains almost all of the variability in the binary target variable.
   - **AIC**: `4.299`, significantly lower than the full model's AIC, suggesting a better fit.

4. **Warnings**:
   - The warnings indicate issues with convergence due to extreme probabilities (`numerically 0 or 1`), which often occur with strong predictors in logistic regression. This suggests the model is overfitting the data or that `prod_comp_mean_scaled` perfectly predicts the outcome for some rows.

---

### Interpretation:
- **`prod_comp_mean_scaled`** is the dominant variable for predicting `high_comprehension`. Its large coefficient (`5149.8`) suggests a significant and positive impact on the log-odds of high comprehension.
- The **model fits the data extremely well**, as indicated by the low residual deviance and AIC.

---

### Next Steps:
1. **Check Model Stability**:
   - Assess multicollinearity (already addressed as we use one predictor).
   - Validate with a test dataset or cross-validation to ensure generalizability.

2. **Visualize the Model**:
   - Plot predicted probabilities vs. `prod_comp_mean_scaled` to visualize the model's performance.

3. **Address Convergence Warnings**:
   - Use **penalized logistic regression** (e.g., ridge or LASSO).
   - Consider reducing the influence of extreme values in `prod_comp_mean_scaled` using transformations like log or square root.
   - Examine the balance of `high_comprehension` classes and consider alternative weighting strategies.

Look at the vif graph, what do you think about my model?

ChatGPT

The VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) values shown in the output indicate that multicollinearity is not a concern in this model. All VIF values are close to 1, which is well below the commonly used threshold of 5 or 10. This means the predictors in your logistic regression model are not strongly correlated.

Next Steps:

	1.	Evaluate Model Performance:
	•	Since multicollinearity is not an issue, focus on evaluating how well the model predicts the outcome using metrics like:
	•	AUC (Area Under Curve) for the ROC curve.
	•	Confusion matrix to evaluate accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
	2.	Interpret the Results:
	•	The VIF values confirm that each predictor independently contributes to the model. You can confidently interpret the coefficients.
	3.	Visualize the Results:
	•	Plot the predicted probabilities against prod_comp_mean_scaled and other predictors (e.g., age_scaled) to observe their effects.

 where is the error coming from

ChatGPT

The error `! Missing $ inserted.` is a LaTeX issue that typically occurs when you are using math mode (or environments like `align`) and there is text outside math mode, or there are issues with unmatched braces or dollar signs.

From your output log, the specific line `l.325 \end{align}` suggests that the problem occurs before the `\end{align}` command in your document, likely because of improperly formatted content within the `align` environment.

---

### Steps to Debug the Error:

1. **Check the Content in `align`**
   Review the equation within the `align` environment (likely the formula you shared). Ensure that:
   - Every variable or math component is wrapped in math mode using `\( ... \)` or `\(...\)` or `$...$`.
   - Any plain text inside the math mode is wrapped in `\text{...}` (from the `amsmath` package).

   Example:
   ```latex
   \begin{align}
   \log \left( \frac{p_i}{1 - p_i} \right) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{age\_scaled}_i + \beta_2 \cdot \text{is\_normingTRUE}_i \\
   &\quad + \beta_3 \cdot \text{broad\_categoryNouns}_i \\
   &\quad + \beta_4 \cdot \text{broad\_categoryFunction_words}_i \\
   &\quad + \beta_5 \cdot \text{broad\_categoryVerbs}_i \\
   p_i &\sim \text{Bernoulli}(\pi_i)
   \end{align}
   ```

   **Common Pitfall:** If `broad_categoryNouns`, `broad_categoryFunction_words`, etc., are not wrapped properly in `\text{}`, LaTeX will misinterpret these as plain text in math mode, causing the "Missing $" error.

---

2. **Simplify and Test**
   Temporarily simplify the formula to isolate the problematic part. For example:
   ```latex
   \begin{align}
   y &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2
   \end{align}
   ```

   If this works, gradually reintroduce your terms until you identify the issue.

---

3. **YAML Header and LaTeX Packages**
   Ensure your YAML header includes the correct LaTeX engine and necessary packages:
   ```yaml
   output:
     pdf_document:
       latex_engine: xelatex
   ```

   If you’re using Quarto, it might look like:
   ```yaml
   format:
     pdf:
       latex-engine: xelatex
   ```

   This ensures compatibility with `\text{}` and other `amsmath` features.

---

4. **Check Your R Markdown Output**
   - If you are writing this in R Markdown, use the `keep_tex: true` option in the YAML header to retain the intermediate `.tex` file for debugging:
     ```yaml
     output:
       pdf_document:
         keep_tex: true
     ```

   - Open the `.tex` file and manually inspect the `align` environment.

---

5. **Line Break or Content Issue**
   Check for unintended line breaks, extra spaces, or comments (`%`) that may disrupt the `align` environment. Ensure the structure is clean and well-formed.

---

6. **Alternative Debugging**
   If the issue persists, try using a simpler math environment such as:
   ```latex
   \[
   \log \left( \frac{p_i}{1 - p_i} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2
   \]
   ```

   Then reintroduce `align` once you’ve confirmed that the formula works.

---

### Likely Cause in Your Case:
The issue seems to stem from the `broad_category...` terms. If they are not wrapped in `\text{}`, LaTeX will attempt to interpret them as math operators or variables, causing errors. Ensure all text labels are wrapped appropriately, as shown in the corrected example above.

---

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and compile your document successfully.

### Explanation:
1. **Intercept ($\beta_0$):** Represents the baseline log-odds when all predictors are at their reference levels.
2. **Age Scaled ($\beta_1$):** The effect of standardized age on the log-odds of having a high vocabulary.
3. **Norming Status ($\beta_2$):** The effect of being part of the norming group (TRUE) compared to non-norming.
4. **Broad Categories ($\beta_3$ to $\beta_9$):** The effects of different broad categories compared to the reference category (likely excluded in the model fitting).

Limitations of Data Collection

While the CDI provides valuable insights, it is subject to certain biases inherent in parental reporting, such as over- or underestimation of a child’s abilities. To address these, the inventory incorporates structured response formats and includes a norming group for comparison. Additionally, measures like standardizing age (scaled) and grouping lexical categories reduce variability and enhance interpretability in the analysis.

ChatGPT

#### Limitations of Data Collection and Handling

While the CDI provides valuable insights into early language development, the method of parental reporting and the nature of the data introduce several limitations. These challenges can affect the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, necessitating careful handling and methodological adjustments to ensure valid conclusions.

---

### 1. **Parental Reporting Bias**
   - **Challenge:**  
     The CDI relies on parents’ observations and self-reporting, which may be influenced by recall errors, social desirability bias, or subjective interpretations of their child’s abilities. For example:
       - Parents might overestimate their child's vocabulary due to pride or misunderstanding of the task.
       - Conversely, they may underestimate their child’s comprehension if certain words are understood in contexts outside of their observation.
   - **Mitigation:**  
     - **Standardized Instructions:** Clear guidelines and examples were provided to parents to reduce ambiguity in interpreting questions and tasks. 
     - **Multiple Cross-Checks:** In some cases, follow-up questions or alternative assessment formats were used to validate the accuracy of the reported data.
     - **Norming Group Inclusion:** By including a norming group as a benchmark, variations in parental reporting could be calibrated against standardized norms, reducing systemic bias.

---

### 2. **Cultural and Linguistic Diversity**
   - **Challenge:**  
     Language development varies significantly across cultures and linguistic contexts, with certain vocabulary categories being more relevant or emphasized in specific environments. For example:
       - A child growing up in a rural area may develop more vocabulary related to nature and agriculture, while urban children might use more object-oriented words.
   - **Mitigation:**  
     - **Culturally Adapted Inventories:** The CDI was adapted for diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds, ensuring that word lists were representative and contextually appropriate.
     - **Broad Category Analysis:** Grouping words into higher-level lexical categories (e.g., nouns, verbs, function words) reduces the impact of cultural specificity and allows for more generalized comparisons.

---

### 3. **Age-Related Variability**
   - **Challenge:**  
     Vocabulary acquisition progresses rapidly during early childhood, with large individual differences in developmental timing. This variability complicates direct comparisons across ages.
   - **Mitigation:**  
     - **Standardizing Age:** Age was standardized (scaled) to account for its non-linear effects, ensuring that differences in vocabulary development were not confounded by chronological age variations.
     - **Threshold Adjustments:** The high vocabulary threshold (prod_comp_mean > 350) was determined based on age-adjusted norms to ensure relevance across developmental stages.

---

### 4. **Missing Data**
   - **Challenge:**  
     Some participants failed to complete the inventory fully, resulting in missing values for comprehension, production, or other variables.
   - **Mitigation:**  
     - **Exclusion of Missing Rows:** Rows with missing comprehension or production scores were excluded from the analysis to ensure data integrity.
     - **Sensitivity Analysis:** Additional analyses were conducted to confirm that excluding missing data did not significantly alter the results or introduce bias.

---

### 5. **Categorical Variable Limitations**
   - **Challenge:**  
     Broad lexical categories (e.g., nouns, verbs) may oversimplify the complexity of word acquisition. For instance:
       - Some words (e.g., “play”) may function as both nouns and verbs, depending on context.
   - **Mitigation:**  
     - **Contextual Validation:** Words were assigned to categories based on their most typical usage to maintain consistency.
     - **Sum Contrasts Encoding:** Categorical variables were encoded using sum contrasts to interpret each category's effect relative to the overall mean.

### 6. **Generalizability of Results**
   - **Challenge:**  
     Since the CDI data primarily reflect early vocabulary in children within a particular demographic or socioeconomic context, the findings may not generalize to all populations.
   - **Mitigation:**  
     - **Diverse Sampling:** Efforts were made to include children from various demographic backgrounds in the data collection process.
     - **Comparative Analysis:** Findings were contextualized against existing research to highlight areas where generalizability might be limited.

The objective of measurement is to translate parental reports of children’s vocabulary into reliable indicators of vocabulary acquisition patterns. To capture patterns in vocabulary acquisition, the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDI),which is a standardized tool for essessing early vocabulary development in young children. It collects detailed information about children’s understanding and usage of words, categorized into lexical groups such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives. These structured observations provide the foundation for the study’s dependent and independent variables. This approach combines ease of administration with high sensitivity to individual differences in language development.

  - Structured Formats: The CDI includes predefined response categories for comprehension and production, minimizing ambiguity in parental reporting.
	-	Norming Group Comparison: A subset of children from norming groups is included as a benchmark to ensure consistency and validity in scoring.
	-	Variable Standardization: Continuous variables such as age are standardized (e.g., scaled) to account for variability and enhance interpretability in the analysis. it is not how my paper is conducted, is more about hot the raw data is collected and raise some concerns

ChatGPT

The objective of measurement in this study is to translate raw parental reports into reliable indicators of vocabulary acquisition patterns in children. The data is derived from the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDI), a widely used tool that collects information on children’s vocabulary comprehension and production through structured parental surveys. These surveys allow parents to report on their child's understanding and use of specific words, grouped into lexical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives. The raw data collected through the CDI forms the basis for creating the study’s dependent and independent variables. 

However, there are several considerations regarding the data collection process:  
- **Parental Reporting Bias**: The reliance on parental reports introduces the potential for bias, including overestimation or underestimation of a child’s abilities. This is inherent to self-reported data and can affect the accuracy of the results.  
- **Standardized Format and Structure**: The CDI employs predefined response categories, which help to minimize ambiguity in reporting and ensure consistency across respondents. This structured approach mitigates some reporting variability but may not fully capture nuances in vocabulary acquisition.  
- **Norming Group Representation**: To improve validity, a subset of children from norming groups is included as a benchmark for comparison. While useful, this raises concerns about whether the norming group adequately represents the population’s diversity in language development.  
- **Temporal Limitations**: The CDI data represents snapshots of vocabulary development at specific ages, which may not account for rapid changes or variations over time in a child’s language acquisition process.  

These limitations highlight the importance of careful interpretation of the data and the need to address potential biases and representational gaps when analyzing children’s vocabulary acquisition patterns.

It seems your kable command is missing some configurations or is encountering an issue. Here’s how you can fix and properly render your table using kable:

# Summarize the 'is_norming' variable
isnorming <- summary(analysis_data$is_norming)

# Convert the named vector to a data frame
isnorming_df <- data.frame(
  Value = names(isnorming),  # Extract the names (e.g., TRUE, FALSE)
  Count = as.numeric(isnorming)  # Extract the counts
)

# Render with kable
knitr::kable(
  isnorming_df,
  col.names = c("Norming Status", "Count"),
  caption = "Distribution of Norming Status in the Dataset"
)

Explanation of Components

	1.	summary():
	•	Summarizes the is_norming variable (e.g., how many TRUE and FALSE values exist).
	2.	Convert to a data frame:
	•	names(isnorming) gives the TRUE or FALSE status.
	•	as.numeric(isnorming) gives the corresponding counts.
	3.	kable():
	•	Adds a human-readable table with column headers (Norming Status and Count) and an optional caption.

This approach should work perfectly, and the table will render as expected. If you still encounter any issues, ensure your kable package and knitr are loaded (library(knitr)). Let me know if you need further clarification!

## Model Justification

Logistic regression is widely used in predictive modeling for categorical outcomes due to its simplicity and robustness. It provides probabilities that are constrained between 0 and 1, ensuring meaningful interpretations for binary outcomes. Unlike other complex models, logistic regression allows for clear coefficient interpretation, offering look into the magnitude and direction of predictor effects. For example, the odds ratios derived from logistic regression help explain how changes in variables like age or norming status influence the probability of high vocabulary acquisition.

Although advanced machine learning models like decision trees, random forests, or neural networks could be used, these methods often lack the interpretability of logistic regression. While these models might yield slightly better predictive performance, they are often considered “black boxes,” making it difficult to identify specific relationships between predictors and outcomes. Given the study’s focus on understanding developmental patterns rather than maximizing predictive accuracy, logistic regression is more appropriate.

Moreover, complex models require larger datasets to avoid overfitting and ensure generalizability, which might not be feasible given the sample size and the structure of the data in this study. Logistic regression strikes a balance between simplicity, interpretability, and predictive performance.

The dataset was split into training and testing subsets to ensure model validation and reduce overfitting. This allows the model to generalize better to unseen data, providing a more reliable assessment of its predictive accuracy. Standardizing continuous predictors, such as age, enhances interpretability and ensures that variables are on a comparable scale, preventing dominance by predictors with larger numerical ranges.

To ensure reproducibility, the preprocessed datasets and the trained model were saved. This practice facilitates verification of results and supports future analyses or extensions of the study. Overall, the logistic regression model offers a clear and interpretable framework for investigating vocabulary acquisition patterns, providing both explanatory power and practical implications.

Model Justification

Logistic regression is an ideal choice for this study, as it is well-suited for binary outcomes such as high vocabulary proficiency (1 = high vocabulary, 0 = not high vocabulary). This method constrains predicted probabilities between 0 and 1, ensuring meaningful and interpretable results. Its simplicity and robustness make it a widely accepted tool in research where the goal is not only prediction but also understanding the relationships between predictors and the outcome. The coefficients in logistic regression provide valuable insights into the magnitude and direction of effects, such as how age or norming status influences the likelihood of high vocabulary acquisition. The derived odds ratios allow for intuitive interpretations, enabling the assessment of the relative importance of different predictors.

While more complex models such as random forests or neural networks could potentially enhance predictive accuracy, they often sacrifice interpretability, rendering the relationships between predictors and outcomes opaque. Given the primary objective of this study—to explore and explain developmental patterns in vocabulary acquisition—logistic regression offers a transparent and interpretable framework. This balance between predictive capability and clarity makes it particularly suited for addressing research questions focused on developmental insights rather than solely maximizing prediction accuracy.

The model’s use of standardized predictors, such as scaled age, ensures that all variables are on a comparable scale, preventing dominance by predictors with larger numerical ranges and enhancing interpretability. Additionally, categorical variables, such as broad lexical categories, are encoded with sum contrasts, allowing for meaningful comparisons and ensuring that the coefficients reflect deviations from the mean effect across all categories. These preprocessing steps not only align with best practices but also improve the robustness of the model.

To further ensure generalizability, the dataset was split into training and testing subsets, allowing for model validation and reducing the risk of overfitting. This approach ensures that the model’s performance can reliably extend to new, unseen data. Logistic regression’s relatively low complexity is particularly advantageous in this context, given the sample size and the need to avoid overfitting while preserving interpretability.

Finally, reproducibility was prioritized through the preservation of preprocessed datasets and the trained model. This facilitates verification of the results and allows for future extensions or refinements of the analysis. In summary, logistic regression provides an appropriate and interpretable framework for investigating vocabulary acquisition patterns, striking a balance between explanatory power, practical application, and predictive performance.

this is my model summary, use it to write the interpreation of the coefficient

ChatGPT

Interpretation of the Model Coefficients

The logistic regression model estimates the relationship between various predictors and the likelihood of achieving high vocabulary proficiency. Here is an interpretation of the key coefficients:
	1.	Intercept (￼):
	•	The intercept represents the log-odds of high vocabulary proficiency when all predictors are at their reference or mean levels (e.g., mean-scaled age, non-norming status, and the baseline category for word types).
	•	Since ￼, the baseline odds of high vocabulary proficiency are less than 50%.
	2.	Age (Scaled) (￼):
	•	For each one standard deviation increase in age, the log-odds of high vocabulary proficiency increase by 1.605.
	•	In terms of odds, ￼, meaning that a one standard deviation increase in age multiplies the odds of high vocabulary proficiency by approximately 5 times.
	3.	Norming Status (￼):
	•	Children in the norming group have a 1.749 increase in the log-odds of achieving high vocabulary compared to non-norming children.
	•	Translating this to odds, ￼, indicating that children in the norming group are 5.75 times more likely to achieve high vocabulary proficiency than non-norming children.
	4.	Broad Category Coefficients:
These coefficients represent the effect of each word category relative to the reference category (not explicitly stated but likely omitted as a baseline).
	•	Adjectives (￼):
	•	The small positive value (￼) suggests a minimal increase in odds for adjectives compared to the reference category.
	•	Function Words (￼):
	•	Similarly, the positive but negligible effect (￼) suggests nearly identical odds compared to the baseline.
	•	Living Things (￼):
	•	This coefficient also reflects a very small positive effect, translating to a 0.5% increase in odds compared to the reference category.
	•	Objects (￼):
	•	A small negative coefficient indicates a 0.5% decrease in odds (￼) for words in the Objects category compared to the baseline.
	•	Places (￼):
	•	The slightly negative value (￼) shows a minor decrease in odds for words in the Places category.
	•	Sensory Words (￼):
	•	A larger negative coefficient (￼) indicates a 1.5% reduction in odds for Sensory Words compared to the baseline.
	•	Verbs (￼):
	•	The minimal positive coefficient (￼) suggests a 0.4% increase in odds for Verbs compared to the reference category.

Summary of Findings:

	1.	Age and Norming Status:
	•	Age and norming status have the largest and most significant effects on the likelihood of achieving high vocabulary proficiency. Older children and those in the norming group are far more likely to demonstrate advanced vocabulary.
	2.	Word Categories:
	•	Most word categories show minimal differences in log-odds relative to the reference group, suggesting that the influence of lexical category is relatively small compared to age and norming status.
	•	Sensory Words and Objects are slightly less likely to be associated with high vocabulary proficiency, while Adjectives, Function Words, and Living Things show marginally positive effects.

This interpretation highlights the dominant role of developmental and contextual factors (age and norming status) over lexical categories in predicting vocabulary proficiency. Let me know if you’d like further clarification or adjustments!

How is the auc curve?

ChatGPT

The Precision-Recall (PR) Curve you’ve shared appears to be a solid diagnostic for your logistic regression model. Here’s an interpretation of the key points from the graph:

Key Insights from the PR Curve

	1.	AUC (Area Under the Curve):
	•	The AUC = 0.71 indicates that your model performs reasonably well at predicting the positive class (high vocabulary). While it’s not perfect, a value above 0.7 suggests decent performance.
	2.	Precision vs. Recall Trade-off:
	•	The curve shows the balance between precision (positive predictive value) and recall (sensitivity) at various probability thresholds.
	•	A high precision indicates that most predicted high vocabulary classifications are correct.
	•	A high recall shows that the model identifies a large proportion of actual high vocabulary cases.
	•	The gradual decline in precision as recall increases suggests the model’s trade-off as it tries to capture more true positives.
	3.	Performance at Low Recall:
	•	The curve starts with high precision at low recall values. This is expected in many models as the threshold is initially strict, leading to fewer but highly accurate positive predictions.
	4.	Decline at Higher Recall:
	•	As recall increases (the model captures more true positives), precision decreases. This indicates that the model starts to misclassify more negatives as positives.
	5.	Use for Imbalanced Data:
	•	Precision-Recall Curves are particularly useful for imbalanced datasets where the positive class (e.g., high vocabulary) might be underrepresented compared to the negative class. This visualization highlights how well the model performs specifically for the positive class.

How to Improve if Needed

	•	If you aim for higher AUC, consider:
	•	Feature engineering (e.g., adding interaction terms or transformations).
	•	Trying non-linear models (e.g., random forest or gradient boosting) for potentially better performance.
	•	Hyperparameter tuning to optimize thresholds.

@fig-age displays the distribution of children’s ages (in months) within the dataset, highlighting key patterns in the sample’s demographic structure. A notable concentration of data is observed among children aged between 24 and 30 months, reflecting an emphasis on capturing vocabulary development during critical periods of language acquisition. These age ranges are known to mark significant milestones in linguistic growth, which could explain their higher representation. Conversely, younger age groups (below 20 months) are underrepresented, likely due to the challenges of assessing vocabulary at earlier stages of development, where verbal communication is less pronounced and parental reporting is more variable.

The dataset also shows distinct peaks at specific ages, such as 25 and 30 months. These sharp spikes may reflect intentional focus points for testing or developmental benchmarks tied to standardized assessments like the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDI). This uneven age distribution underscores the importance of age as a critical factor in analyzing vocabulary acquisition. While the high concentration of data at older ages enhances the analysis into advanced vocabulary development, it also necessitates caution in generalizing findings to underrepresented age groups. This observation emphasizes the need to standardize age in statistical models to account for variability across different age groups. write a new section talking about age varaible for me

Age Variable

Age is a critical predictor in understanding vocabulary acquisition patterns in children, as it captures developmental progress over time. As illustrated in @fig-age, the dataset highlights the distribution of children’s ages, with a notable concentration of participants between 24 and 30 months. This range coincides with key developmental milestones in language growth, where children typically experience significant gains in vocabulary comprehension and production. The higher representation in these age groups likely reflects a research emphasis on critical periods of linguistic development, making this dataset well-suited for examining advanced vocabulary acquisition.

Conversely, children below 20 months are underrepresented, which may be attributed to challenges in assessing vocabulary at earlier stages. During this period, verbal communication is less pronounced, and parental reporting is more variable, potentially leading to measurement difficulties. This uneven representation emphasizes the importance of accounting for age variability in the analysis. For instance, standardized age variables can improve the interpretability of statistical models by ensuring that coefficients reflect meaningful changes per unit of standardized age.

Additionally, the dataset reveals sharp peaks at specific ages, such as 25 and 30 months. These spikes may align with intentional testing focus points or developmental benchmarks tied to standardized assessments, such as the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDI). While these concentrated data points provide valuable insights into critical periods of language acquisition, they also highlight the need for caution when generalizing findings to younger or less represented age groups. Overall, the variability in age distribution underscores its significance as a key variable, necessitating careful handling to ensure robust and generalizable results.

BASED ON THE NEW GRAPH, REWRITE MY FIG-CAP AND RESULT SECTION @fig-percent visualizes the relationship between age and production vocabulary scores, focusing on different percentiles of the distribution. The scatterplot shows 1000 resampled individual production scores as gray dots. Lines represent percentiles (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th), capturing central tendencies and variability across ages. The 50th percentile (median) line provides a benchmark for the typical vocabulary production score at each age, whereas the 10th and 90th percentiles outline the lower and upper ranges of vocabulary development. The gradual upward trend of the median line reflects consistent growth in production vocabulary as children age, with a widening gap between the percentiles at later ages. This widening suggests increasing variability in vocabulary acquisition, with some children advancing much faster than others in production abilities.

The data indicates that children in the 90th percentile acquire vocabulary at a significantly faster rate than their peers, as evidenced by the steeper slope of the topmost line. Conversely, the 10th and 25th percentiles show more gradual, stable growth, suggesting slower development for children in these groups. The broader range of scores at older ages emphasizes the heterogeneity of developmental trajectories, with some children reaching vocabulary sizes substantially larger than the median while others remain below average. These findings underscore the diversity in early language acquisition and validate the importance of considering individual differences when evaluating children’s vocabulary development.
The graph illustrates the production vocabulary of children across different ages (in months). Individual data points (gray dots) represent raw production scores for each participant. Colored lines correspond to standardized percentiles—10th (blue), 25th (light blue), 50th (green), 75th (yellow), and 90th (red)—showing trends in vocabulary production distribution over time.

Here’s the revised figure caption and results section based on your new graph:

Figure Caption:
@fig-percent displays the relationship between age (in months) and production vocabulary scores, highlighting the variability and central tendencies in the data. Individual production scores (gray dots) represent 3000 resampled observations, while colored lines denote key percentiles (10th in blue, 25th in light blue, 50th in green, 75th in yellow, and 90th in red). These lines illustrate the trajectory of vocabulary development across different age groups, emphasizing patterns in the central and extreme portions of the distribution. The upward trend of the median (50th percentile) line reflects consistent growth in vocabulary production with age, while the growing distance between percentile lines at older ages reveals increasing variability in language acquisition.

Results Section:
The analysis reveals a clear upward trend in production vocabulary as children age, with the median (50th percentile) line serving as a benchmark for typical development. The 90th percentile exhibits a significantly steeper trajectory, indicating that children at the upper end of the distribution acquire vocabulary at a faster rate compared to their peers. Conversely, the 10th and 25th percentiles demonstrate more gradual growth, reflecting slower vocabulary development in these groups.

At younger ages, the percentile lines remain close together, suggesting relatively uniform vocabulary acquisition across children. However, as age increases, the divergence between percentiles becomes more pronounced, indicating a greater range of individual variability in vocabulary production. Children in the 90th percentile consistently outpace their peers, achieving vocabulary sizes significantly higher than the median. Meanwhile, children in the lower percentiles maintain slower, steadier progress.

These findings underscore the heterogeneity in early language development and highlight the importance of considering individual differences when assessing or supporting vocabulary acquisition. The widening gap between percentiles at older ages suggests that tailored interventions may be beneficial for children at the lower end of the distribution to support more equitable language development outcomes.

## Limitations and Future Directions

@song also point out in their study on 264 typically developing Chinese children (145 boys and 119 girls) were included from a longitudinal study of language. While the findings offer valuable directions, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, the reliance on parental reports introduces potential biases, including over- or underestimation of children’s abilities. Future studies could complement CDI data with observational or experimental measures to enhance reliability. Second, the cross-sectional nature of the data limits the ability to track individual developmental trajectories. Longitudinal studies are needed to capture within-child variability and the dynamics of vocabulary growth over time.Familial factors and reading or language related cognitive skills were found to be associated with these developmental subgroups.

Additionally, the dataset we have now is limited on the word categories. Future data collection could focus more on the word types and provides more feasible analysis on the lexcial category learning pattern. Besides, Future research should also explore the influence of environmental and contextual factors, such as language exposure, educational interventions, and socio-economic status, on vocabulary acquisition. These factors could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying linguistic development.

The strongest developmental inferences can be made by the examination of longitudinal data, in which children’s individual development is measured multiple times using the same instrument. Unfortunately, relatively little of our CDI data comes from this type of repeated administration. There is a substantial amount of two-administration longitudinal data for several languages, but only a few have more than two observations for individual children.In general, this aspect of our data is a consequence of the fact that, for normative datasets, pure cross-sectional data collection is used to ensure statistical independence between datapoints. Thus, we must typically settle for using the large amount of available cross-sectional data to average out individual variability.

Limitations and Future Directions

While this study provides valuable insights into vocabulary acquisition patterns in young children, several limitations must be acknowledged, along with directions for future research.

Reliance on Parental Reports:
The primary data source for this study, the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDI), relies on parental reports, which are inherently subjective. Parents may overestimate or underestimate their child’s vocabulary abilities due to limited observation, memory biases, or social desirability. Future research should complement CDI data with more objective methods, such as direct observational studies, naturalistic recordings, or experimental tasks, to enhance data reliability and provide a more accurate picture of children’s language development.

Cross-Sectional Nature of the Data:
This study is based on cross-sectional data, which captures a snapshot of vocabulary development at specific age points but does not allow for tracking individual growth trajectories over time. Longitudinal studies are essential to understand within-child variability and the dynamic progression of vocabulary acquisition. Future work should prioritize repeated measurements across longer time spans to uncover the mechanisms behind individual differences in learning rates and patterns.

Limited Word Category Representation:
The current dataset focuses on broad lexical categories, but some groups, such as Sensory Words and Adjectives, are underrepresented. This limitation restricts the ability to analyze nuanced trends in less common or context-dependent vocabulary. Future datasets should aim to include a more balanced representation of word types, particularly abstract and low-frequency categories, to facilitate a more comprehensive analysis of vocabulary diversity.

Environmental and Contextual Factors:
Although this study accounts for predictors such as age and norming status, it does not incorporate environmental and contextual variables that are known to influence vocabulary acquisition, such as socio-economic status, bilingualism, and parental language use. Future research should integrate these factors into models to explore their impact on language learning, particularly in diverse and underserved populations.

Challenges in Norming Data:
The imbalance between norming and non-norming groups presents another limitation. While norming groups provide valuable benchmarks, they may not fully capture the diversity of the broader population. Future efforts should ensure that norming samples are representative of various socio-economic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds to improve generalizability.

Need for Longitudinal and Mixed-Methods Approaches:
The strongest developmental insights come from longitudinal studies, where children’s vocabulary is tracked multiple times using consistent measures. However, CDI datasets are predominantly cross-sectional due to the logistical challenges of repeated administration. To address this, future research could combine longitudinal designs with mixed-methods approaches, incorporating quantitative and qualitative data to better understand the complexity of vocabulary acquisition.

By addressing these limitations, future studies can build on this work to provide a deeper, more nuanced understanding of early language development, paving the way for improved educational strategies and interventions tailored to individual and contextual needs.

This graph presents the distribution of predicted probabilities for different word categories, illustrating how confidently the model predicts the presence of words within these groups. Each panel corresponds to a specific category—such as “Activities,” “Adjectives,” and “Function Words”—and the density plots show the relative frequency of predicted probabilities ranging from 0 to 1. Categories like “Function Words” and “Adjectives” exhibit sharp peaks, suggesting that predictions for these word types are more consistent and confident, likely due to their frequent and predictable usage. In contrast, distributions for “Activities,” “Verbs,” and “Living Things” are more multimodal, indicating greater variability in the model’s predictions for these groups.

Notably, several categories display a concentration of predictions near 0, reflecting words that the model predicts with low probability. For example, “Sensory Words” and “Places” have a pronounced density at the lower end of the probability range, suggesting that the model struggles to predict these categories with confidence. On the other hand, the broader spread of predictions in categories like “Objects” and “Living Things” highlights significant heterogeneity, where some words are predicted confidently while others are not. The multimodal nature of some distributions points to subgroups within categories, where certain words are systematically easier or harder for the model to predict.

These results underscore both the strengths and limitations of the predictive model. For simpler or more predictable categories, like “Function Words,” the model performs well, as evidenced by the distinct peaks. However, for more complex or diverse groups, such as “Activities” and “Verbs,” the variability in predictions suggests opportunities for improvement. Understanding these patterns provides actionable insights for refining the model, particularly by addressing underperforming categories or identifying features that contribute to variability in predictions. This analysis also emphasizes the importance of tailoring approaches for word categories with lower predictability, potentially enhancing overall model robustness.

The is_norming variable categorizes children into two groups: the norming group and the non-norming group. The norming group serves as a standardized sample, providing a benchmark for assessing vocabulary development and enabling reliable comparisons across the dataset. This group is essential for ensuring the validity of the analysis by offering a consistent reference point for evaluating individual and group-level differences in vocabulary acquisition.

The dataset is predominantly composed of non-norming children, with only a small proportion belonging to the norming group. This imbalance reflects the inherent challenges of including a sufficiently broad and representative norming sample in large-scale assessments. While the non-norming group captures diverse linguistic and demographic contexts, the norming group remains vital for calibrating and interpreting vocabulary development patterns, particularly in early language acquisition studies. @tbl-norming illustrates this distribution, highlighting the predominance of non-norming children in the dataset.

The is_norming variable is included in the logistic regression model to account for potential systematic differences between the norming and non-norming groups. As the norming group represents a standardized sample used as a benchmark for vocabulary development, its inclusion ensures that variations in the likelihood of achieving a high vocabulary score are not confounded by differences in group composition or assessment protocols. It allows the model to estimate whether membership in the norming group significantly influences vocabulary acquisition outcomes. This is particularly important given the inherent imbalance in the dataset, where the non-norming group constitutes the majority. By controlling for is_norming, the model can differentiate between developmental patterns attributable to broader population diversity versus those arising from the structured selection of the norming sample.

The is_norming variable classifies children into two groups: norming and non-norming. The norming group serves as a standardized sample, providing benchmarks for assessing vocabulary development and enabling consistent comparisons across the dataset. Although the dataset is predominantly composed of non-norming children, norming data is critical for calibrating and interpreting developmental patterns, particularly in early language acquisition studies.

This variable is included in the logistic regression model to account for systematic differences between the groups. By doing so, the model ensures that variations in the likelihood of achieving a high vocabulary score are not confounded by differences in group composition or assessment protocols. Despite the imbalance, this approach allows the model to differentiate patterns arising from population diversity versus those influenced by structured norming samples, as illustrated in @tbl-norming.
